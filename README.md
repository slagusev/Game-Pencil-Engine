Building Game Pencil From Source Code
=====================================
We have made a helpful guide on how to compile Game Pencil from source [here](http://gamepencil.pawbyte.com/building-source-code/)

**This editor is coded completely in C/C++ and uses the SDL Library for display, input, output and audio.**

Please note that using the .MP3 format is strongly not recommended due to licensing fees.
